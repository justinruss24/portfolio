				<p>My name is Justin Russell. I am a 25 year old Web Development student at Lambda School. I graduated
					with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Marketing from San Jose State University back in 2017.
					I have spent most of my life living all up and down California, with a short 1 year stint in Hawaii
					before finding a new home in Portland, Oregon.</p>
				<p>When I'm not working or watching sports, you can find me on the golf course with a cold beer in my
					hand and my golf bag over my shoulder.</p>
				<p>I am a former collegiate baseball player and have only recently fallen in love with coding and the
					process behind Web Development. By the way, check out my <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.
					I found Lambda after running into the CEO and Founder's twitter page and loved their mission and
					growth. I couldn't be more certain that this is the school for me.</p>

				<span id="me-img" class="image main"><a href="https://color-game-inky.now.sh/" target="_blank"><img src="images/colorgame.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<p>This project uses mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A random RGB color code is generated, along with 6 different colors. The user is supposed to guess what color the RGB code represents. 
				</p>
				<span id="me-img" class="image main"><a href="https://virtual-bar.justinruss24.now.sh/" target="_blank"><img src="images/virtualbar.jpg.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<p>This Virtual Bar was built using Create-React-App and multiple react components. It is hooked up to a free backend API that will provide the user with a random drink that's the "Bartender's Choice" and display the drink as well as a picture and its main base alcohol. This module explores asynchronous action creators in Redux.

				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<p>Justin Anthony Russell
					<br>25 years old</br>
					<i class="fas fa-map-pin"></i> Portland, OR
					<br>Web Developer</br></p>
					
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/portland.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				
				<p>I am currently a Web Development student attending the online Lambda School. When I'm away from my
					computer you can find me watching sports or out playing golf.
					I love anything that has to do with the Lakers and Yankees, and will watch any form of NFL football
					regardless of who is playing.
					At night I like to go out to see movies, watch a comedy show, or go enjoy some of the great food
					that Portland has to offer.
				</p>
				<p>Growing up in California, my life was centered around all things sports, especially baseball.
					After being cut from my collegiate team as a Junior, I struggled to find my place in society as
					something other than an athlete.
					I picked up golf as a hobby and that has consumed most of my free time that had opened up once
					baseball was over. It wasn't until
					a few years after I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from SJSU that I discovered
					coding and all of the challenges that came with it.
					My competitive spirit helps drive me to become a better Web Developer every day and help others
					around me do the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					Growing up, I was never into video games or computers. It wasn't until I matured that I found the
					beauty in Web Development. The concept of adding these skills to my business/team oriented mindset
					seemed like a no brainer moving forward in my life and career and I am as eager as ever to embrace
					this journey.
